##Introduction

Data has been taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. I  used the published "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the Course web site.

##Data Description

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

 - Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
 - Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
 - Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
 - Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
 - Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
 - Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
 - Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
 - Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
 - Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

##Making Plots Steps

The goal is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the plots from the Course site.

 * Clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

 * For each plot 

    + Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

    + Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

    + Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced and the code that creates the PNG file.
    + Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
    + push git repository to GitHub . 

##Result

All The four reconstructed plots are showed at GitHub repository.
